SmokeSNET
=========

Hey! Welcome to the main repo for **SmokeSNET**. This will contain the current, main build for SmokeSNET. If you're after working code, check the main branch here. If you're looking for some things that aren't quite ready for putting into the main codebase, check out my [RnD repo, over here](https://github.com/tangohead/SmokeSNET-RnD).

What is SmokeSNET?
------------------

SmokeSNET is a university project by Matt Smith. It aims to investigate the effects of social networking on people attempting to give up smoking. 

How is it going to work?
------------------------

Without going into too much detail, it will represent the social network as a directional graph with humans being the nodes. Nodes will posess characteristics and the ability to make decisions to the level of being able to reconfigure their social ties.

What are you using to do this?
------------------------------

It'll largely be written in Java (some bits may be in Python, because I'm trying my best to like it) using the [Repast Simphony](http://repast.sourceforge.net/) agent-based modelling environment. Other useful things that are being used are:

* [Stanford Datasets](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/)
* [Gephi](https://gephi.org/)

More items will be added above as I go along.
